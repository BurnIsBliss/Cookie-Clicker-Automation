# Cookie-Clicker-Automation

This is my way of automating the [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/v10466/) browser game using Python and Selenium.

Cookie Clicker is a JavaScript based game. It is an 'incrementer' type based game. Where the point of the game is to bake cookies by clicking on a giant cookie until you have enough cookies to buy upgrades.

With the 'CookieClicker.py' Python script I have automated the processes of collection of cookies and getting upgrades.
