# Cookie-Clicker-Automation

Built a Python-Selenium script to automate [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/v10466/), a browser-based game.

Cookie Clicker is an 'incrementer' type JavaScript based game. The point of the game is to bake cookies by clicking on a giant cookie until you have enough of them to buy upgrades.

With the 'CookieClicker.py' Python script I have automated the processes of collection of cookies and getting upgrades.
